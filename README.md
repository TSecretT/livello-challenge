# Livello Challenge

This repository is created to deponstrate the result of a Livello Challange. 

The task is to create an Expo React Native app that fetches the movies API based on user's title input and displays them in the list. Then user is able to click on any of the appeared result and wil open a page with movie's details.


## Installation

You should have expo-cli installed in order to run the app.
Then install dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
  npm install
  expo start
```


    
## Notes

- Since the API does not have an endpoint with popular / latest movie releases, it was decided to not load any movies at start. User should enter movie title first in order to fetch the data.
- The work was focused more on the features rather than design.
